I attended a meeting with the council before the RCOS meeting to discuss changed to the website and new ideas. The forum
was scrapped for a form that could be filled out to submit question or conscern. This is to mitgate a large influx
of messages that we hav eto deal with. We also created a new email that all members could have access to. This email would
also intake the forms that people fill out. The followign classes were created for people to fill out for the form:

Name (ability to be anonymous)
Date (automatic)
Email
Major
Year
Description/Concern

I learned python with the help of my partner and was bale to make classes for the form. I was also able to only allow the desciption and conscerns
section to be mandatory in case someone wants to submit a conscern anonymously. I also compiled a list of everyones image
and have begun uploading everyones profile on the site. I have also continued to contact our IT dept. but they seem to be thinking our
site is only dynamic and one page. They have taken a while to get back to me so it may take a while to integrate with the MANE depts
site.

I have continued to communicate with our IT department. I sent an email to ensure that, in the event we decided to integrate with the new MANE 
department site, their framwork would work with hours. I have also begun collecting links to other councils at RPI for our FAQ. The purpose of this 
is to mitigate any questions that could be answered on other sites. 
These are the following links:

We also solved an error in which other computers could not sign in to the admin page. Through the downloading of a package we were able to
allow signing in on my computer and the adding of my account as a admin. The member page was now up in running, so all of the information of each member
could now be added. We still need images of each member, and that will be brought up at the next meeting.

I have been very sick for the past week and a half, but have continued to make progress on the website. After communication with the MANE department,
i was informed that a new MANE Departent website was underway. After continuted communication, I was informed the MANE department could not provide server
space to us to host the website. I have contacted Dr. Turner to see if we could secure hosting space. I also informed the MANE SAC members of this via the following
message:
Attention all. I heard back from the MANE dept and it looks like we cannot get our own server space for the site
They are currently working on a new MANE site, adn said we could integrate our site into their's (like a subsection). i
am going ot try to contact the CS dept and/or get server space thorugh RCOS, but if we cant, are we amendable to integrating
with the MANE dept site.

Next week i will update with thoughts from the MANE sac members. I wil continute to open communications between the CS and MANE dept to secure server space. We have
continued to work on the forum as well to allow to submissions of questions.

Today we focused on working on and completing the events page. We determined that the events page needs the following:
1. An area to include an image of the event, a poster, or some related image
2. A title of the event, which is limited to 30 characters
3. Description of the event
4. date and time of event
5. Loction of Event
6. Link to event/website/discord/related links
The ability for members to edit, add and remove events will be important. i also want to implement a system to email all relevant individiduals once an event is posted. The MANE SAC's biggest event is Coffee and Questions, where we run a poll of the MANE student body to gauge their general mental and acedemic wellbeing and progress. Reaching as many MANE students as possible via an email with all relevant information will be extremely important
Not all information needs to be filled. For example, a link may not be needed, and the event may not have an image. Only the desciption and the title are mandatory to add an event. I am currently working with the department to secure service space, but they have been slow to get back to me.

Over the weekend, I finalized the member information for each member of the council. I still have to aquire an image for each member. This is the following information collected

Kaylee Aya-AY
Major: Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering
Year: Junior
Description: I am a junior dualing in aerospace and mechanical engineering with a minor in media and culture. I mostly work on the flyers and monitor social media for MANE SAC. I'm also the Alumni Relations Director of SWE, a mentor for the Women Mentoring Program, and social media manager for the Union Clubhouse Pub.

Camden Blake
Position: President
Major: Nuclear Engineering
Year: 5th year PhD student and BS in Nuclear Engineering
Description: 5th year PhD student and BS in Nuclear Engineering from RPI
Yes, this is my 9th year here at RPI, I have been here longer than several professors.  My advisor is Dr. Wei Ji and my research is on a fast and efficient method for storing large quantities of thermal neutron scatter data.  The main thrust of my research is to create a on the fly in temperature data storage technique that allows for sampling thermal scattering data at arbitrary temperatures in Monte Carlo applications.

Kairvi Lodhiya
Major: Aeronautical Engineering
Year: 2nd year PHD
I am in my 2nd year PhD. I am working with Dr. Diana Andra Borca Tascuic. My research is about energy transfer in electro-mechanical coupled oscillator. The application of this system is in Energy Harvesters. 
Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/kairvi-lodhiya

Rene Mai
Major: Mechanical Engineering
Year: 4th Year PhD student
Description : I am a fourth-year mechanical engineering PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. My research focuses on controls for shared autonomous systems. Fundamentally, the question that drives my research is how humans can build our technology and devices so that we achieve peak performance together. I integrate engineering and cognitive science perspectives in my approach to symbiotic human-machine autonomy (also called shared autonomy). My focus is modeling human-autonomy interaction in complex systems such as robotics and transportation as a dynamical system, rather than from a social or data-driven perspective.

Some more linkeind links ahve to be aquired, but this it the bulk of the information. A desciption of the MANE SAC was needed to the "About us" page, so the following was made:

The Mechanical, Aeronautical, and Nuclear Engineering Department Student Advisory Council consists of graduate and undergraduate students of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute dedicated to being the voice of the students. We act as a liaison between the MANE Department Head, Dr. Antoinette Maniatty, and MANE Students at RPI. We host events for students and facilitate a questionnaire at the end of the semester to gauge the academic and mental standing, as well as concerns of the student body, and voice this to professors and faculty.

Before RCOS, I attended a meeting with the MANE SAC to discuss further deliverables. We decided to add a section for common questions. This would allow the student advisory council to limit any questions. We further fleshed out the different sections of the website. The sections would be as follows:
1. An about us page that has information about the council and what we do
2. An events page that logs any important upcoming events the MANE Department
3. A member page that showcases all members of the council, their role, their major, and a short description about them
4. A forum for students to ask questions, either anonymously or not, which has the ability for council members to respond

After receiving aproval from the council, this was then communicated with the team. I started compiling information regarding the members, and made an outline for the members page:

Several new members may be added to the council, so the ability to add new members will be extremely important. I added a issue ticket on GitHub to add a new section for a forum page. In addtion to this I have reached out to several RPI DOT CIO and MANE faculty to aquire server space for the site.
