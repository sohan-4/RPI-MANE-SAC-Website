Today we focused on working on and completing the events page. We determined that the events page needs the following:
1. An area to include an image of the event, a poster, or some related image
2. A title of the event, which is limited to 30 characters
3. Description of the event
4. date and time of event
5. Loction of Event
6. Link to event/website/discord/related links
The ability for members to edit, add and remove events will be important. i also want to implement a system to email all relevant individiduals once an event is posted. The MANE SAC's biggest event is Coffee and Questions, where we run a poll of the MANE student body to gauge their general mental and acedemic wellbeing and progress. Reaching as many MANE students as possible via an email with all relevant information will be extremely important
Not all information needs to be filled. For example, a link may not be needed, and the event may not have an image. Only the desciption and the title are mandatory to add an event. I am currently working with the department to secure service space, but they have been slow to get back to me.

Over the weekend, I finalized the member information for each member of the council. I still have to aquire an image for each member. This is the following information collected

Kaylee Aya-AY
Major: Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering
Year: Junior
Description: I am a junior dualing in aerospace and mechanical engineering with a minor in media and culture. I mostly work on the flyers and monitor social media for MANE SAC. I'm also the Alumni Relations Director of SWE, a mentor for the Women Mentoring Program, and social media manager for the Union Clubhouse Pub.

Camden Blake
Position: President
Major: Nuclear Engineering
Year: 5th year PhD student and BS in Nuclear Engineering
Description: 5th year PhD student and BS in Nuclear Engineering from RPI
Yes, this is my 9th year here at RPI, I have been here longer than several professors.  My advisor is Dr. Wei Ji and my research is on a fast and efficient method for storing large quantities of thermal neutron scatter data.  The main thrust of my research is to create a on the fly in temperature data storage technique that allows for sampling thermal scattering data at arbitrary temperatures in Monte Carlo applications.

Liam Coll:
Position: Secretary
Major: Mechanical Engineering
Year: Junior
Description: I am a second-semester junior studying mechanical engineering here at RPI. I am currently the secretary and website manager of the MANE Student Advisory Council. I am part of the Undergraduate Research Program, working with a startup to develop a new design for a wind turbine that utilizes an active deflector through CFD and physical testing. I am also on the E Board for Circle K, which is RPIâ€™s volunteering club, and the STEM lead and founder of the RPI chapter of the Onero Institute, a youth-driven think tank focusing on international affairs. I am a vegetarian, a coffee addict, and a huge Star Wars fan.

Kairvi Lodhiya
Major: Aeronautical Engineering
Year: 2nd year PHD
I am in my 2nd year PhD. I am working with Dr. Diana Andra Borca Tascuic. My research is about energy transfer in electro-mechanical coupled oscillator. The application of this system is in Energy Harvesters. 
Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/kairvi-lodhiya

Rene Mai
Major: Mechanical Engineering
Year: 4th Year PhD student
Description : I am a fourth-year mechanical engineering PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. My research focuses on controls for shared autonomous systems. Fundamentally, the question that drives my research is how humans can build our technology and devices so that we achieve peak performance together. I integrate engineering and cognitive science perspectives in my approach to symbiotic human-machine autonomy (also called shared autonomy). My focus is modeling human-autonomy interaction in complex systems such as robotics and transportation as a dynamical system, rather than from a social or data-driven perspective.

Melvina Quartey
Major:Aeronautical Engineering
Year: 2nd Year PhD Student
Descption: I am a second year Aeronautical Engineering PhD student at the RPI MANE department. Currently a member of Prof. Lucy Zhang's Computational Mechanics Lab, my research focuses on using quantum computers to simulate fluid flows. I am studying the development of quantum algorithms towards the potential improvement of speed and memory use in computational fluid dynamics.

Some more linkeind links ahve to be aquired, but this it the bulk of the information. A desciption of the MANE SAC was needed to the "About us" page, so the following was made:

The Mechanical, Aeronautical, and Nuclear Engineering Department Student Advisory Council consists of graduate and undergraduate students of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute dedicated to being the voice of the students. We act as a liaison between the MANE Department Head, Dr. Antoinette Maniatty, and MANE Students at RPI. We host events for students and facilitate a questionnaire at the end of the semester to gauge the academic and mental standing, as well as concerns of the student body, and voice this to professors and faculty.

Before RCOS, I attended a meeting with the MANE SAC to discuss further deliverables. We decided to add a section for common questions. This would allow the student advisory council to limit any questions. We further fleshed out the different sections of the website. The sections would be as follows:
1. An about us page that has information about the council and what we do
2. An events page that logs any important upcoming events the MANE Department
3. A member page that showcases all members of the council, their role, their major, and a short description about them
4. A forum for students to ask questions, either anonymously or not, which has the ability for council members to respond

After receiving aproval from the council, this was then communicated with the team. I started compiling information regarding the members, and made an outline for the members page:

Several new members may be added to the council, so the ability to add new members will be extremely important. I added a issue ticket on GitHub to add a new section for a forum page. In addtion to this I have reached out to several RPI DOT CIO and MANE faculty to aquire server space for the site.
