Before RCOS, I attended a meeting with the MANE SAC to discuss further deliverables. We decided to add a section for common questions. This would allow the student advisory council to limit any questions. We further fleshed out the different sections of the website. The sections would be as follows:
1. An about us page that has information about the council and what we do
2. An events page that logs any important upcoming events the MANE Department
3. A member page that showcases all members of the council, their role, their major, and a short description about them
4. A forum for students to ask questions, either anonymously or not, which has the ability for council members to respond

After receiving aproval from the council, this was then communicated with the team. I started compiling information regarding the members, and made an outline for the members page:

Several new members may be added to the council, so the ability to add new members will be extremely important. I added a issue ticket on GitHub to add a new section for a forum page. In addtion to this I have reached out to several RPI DOT CIO and MANE faculty to aquire server space for the site.
