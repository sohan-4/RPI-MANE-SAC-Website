				<p>
						The Mechanical, Aeronautical, and Nuclear Engineering Department Student Advisory Council consists of graduate and
    				 undergraduate students of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute dedicated to being the voice of the students. We act as
      				a liaison between the MANE Department Head, Dr. Antoinette Maniatty, and MANE Students at RPI. We host events for 
      				students and facilitate a questionnaire at the end of the semester to gauge the academic and mental standing, as 
     				 well as concerns of the student body, and voice this to professors and faculty.
